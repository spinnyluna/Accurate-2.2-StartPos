# AccPercentage

This mod fixes Percentages in 2.2 Levels using StartPos. This only works in 2.2 levels and uses the correct time based percentages, instead of x-position. For 2.1 StartPos copies made in 2.2 you will still need a dedicated mod for that.

## TODO
- Integrate the 2.1 StartPos fix so this is the only Percentage Fix mod needed
