# AccPercentage

This mod fixes Percentages in 2.2 Levels using StartPos. This only works in 2.2 levels and uses the correct time based percentages, instead of x-position. 
This mod probably doesnt work correctly if you have levels with direction changes. This mod also does *not* fix 2.1 percentages.

## TODO
- Add Channel support so direction changes work
- Add some smarter System to detect if a level is 2.2 or 2.1 (maybe add a toggle)
- Integrate the 2.1 StartPos fix so this is the only Percentage Fix mod needed
